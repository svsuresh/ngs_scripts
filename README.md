# RNA seq data analysis

RNA data can be used to call variants and/or for differential expression analysis. This repo contains bash scripts for running differential gene expression and variant calling. For variant calling, **GATK Best practices workflow for variant calling in RNASEQ** script is provided. For differential gene expression **Tophat2-HTSEQ/Featurecounts** and **Tophat2-Cufflinks-Cummerbund (Tuxedo suite protocol 1)** scripts are provided. **cummerbund R script** is provided separate. Please note that tuxexo suite protocol 1 not suggested, rather new tuxedo protocols with **HISAT2-StringTie-Ballgown** protocol is preferred in place of earlier protocol. New protocol is provided in another repository of mine, as a [tuxedo 2 workflow](https://github.com/svsuresh/tuxedo2_snakemake) written using snakemake library.
